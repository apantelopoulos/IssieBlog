# What is ISSIE

**I**nteractive **S**chematic **S**imulator and **I**ntegrated **E**ditor **(ISSIE)** is a very easy to use application for digital circuit design and simulation. It is targeted at students and hobbyists that want to get a grasp of Digital Electronics concepts in a simple and fun way. Issie is designed to be beginner-friendly and guide the users toward their goals via clear error messages and visual clues. Issie is developed and actively used in teaching at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

Issie has been well tested on designs with up to 15,000 schematic components. We expect it to be reasonably performant on much larger designs as well. The simulation speed is approximately 2000 component-clocks per ms. Thus a circuit with 1000 components would run at 2000 clocks per second. Issie creates fully synchronous circuits with a single clock: logic with asynchronous loops is currently not supported.

The application is mostly written in F#, which gets transpiled to JavaScript via the [Fable](https://www.fable.com) compiler. [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) is then used to convert the developed web-app to a cross-platform application.

# Key Features

{% include module.html 
    image_path = "img/catalogue.gif" 
    title = "Component Library"
    description = "ISSIE has an extensive and complete library of components available in the 'Catalogue' menu. Components include low-level gates and flipflops as well as larger blocks: RAMs, ROMs, n-bit registers and adders. The lack of HDL-based combinational logic is partly filled by special components: Bus Select (extracts a bit-field), Bus Compare (decodes a min-term of a bus).
    <br><br>
    Viewer components are used to (optionally) view simulation waveforms of nodes on subsheets. Wire label components allow any number of nodes on one design sheet to be connected without visible wires.
    <br><br> 
    Under 'THIS PROJECT' you can find all other design sheets of your project as custom components which can be added to your current sheet and replicate the sheet logic."

{% include module.html 
    image_path="img/wireRouting.gif" 
    title="Wire Routing"
    description="ISSIE schematic component ports are connected using drag-and-drop: each connection represents a wire or bus. ISSIE has two methods of routing wires: **Auto-routing** and **Manual-routing**. 
    <br><br>
    Wires will all start out as Auto-routed, which means that the wireâ€™s path is created automatically by the program. This path will update when moving any connected components. ISSIE also allows for manual routing, where the user may manipulate segments of the wire as desired to make the circuit more readable."

<br><br>

{% include module.html 
    image_path="img/canvasCustomisation.gif" 
    title="Canvas Customisation"
    description="The ISSIE canvas is fully customisable to allow the creation of readable and good-looking schematics. **Specifically:** <br><br> (a) Rotate, Flip and Move around all symbols <br> (b) Change and Move around the symbols' labels <br> (c) Manually route wires as you like <br> (d) Auto-align elements <br> (e) Select the wire type you desire (radiussed, jump or modern wires)"

{% include module.html 
    image_path="img/widthError.gif" 
    title="Width Inference"
    description="Wires will automatically be created the correct width using a width inference algorithm. Wires connecting two ports of incompatible widths will be highlighted red and an error message shown, as will multiply driven wires. Additional sanity checks (e.g. for combinational loops, or unconnected ports) are made before simulation with errors highlighted visually."

{% include module.html 
    image_path="img/stepSimulation.gif" 
    title="Step Simulation"
    description="Step Simulation allows the user to 'step' or cycle through each clock tick, and view the current design sheet's Output and Viewer component information. It also allows users to view how the state changes in stateful components such as RAM." 
%}

<br><br>

{% include module.html 
    image_path="img/waveSimulation.gif" 
    title="Waveform Simulation"
    description="Waveform Simulation allows the user to see the values in each selected connected circuit element (Netlist) over time as a waveform. The waveform simulator allows users to move waveforms up/down in the list to make the simulation more readable. Users may cycle through the simulator using the arrows to directly go to a specific clock cycle. Alternatively there is a scrollbar for the Waveform simulator that will automatically lengthen the simulation once the end is reached. The values in the waveform simulator can be viewed in various formats: binary, hexadecimal, unsigned decimal and signed decimal. The Waveform Simulator also features a draggable sidebar to partition screen space dynamically between waveforms and circuit.
    <br><br>

    Waveform Simulation also allows for the simulation and contents viewing of memory components such as RAM.

    image_path="img/verilogOutput.png" 
    title="Verilog Output"
    description="Users may convert their ISSIE schematic design into a Verilog file using the 'Write design as verilog' option found in the header bar of the application. This allows great flexibility as ISSIE designs may be used in more complex design tools and other programs that use Verilog; allowing ISSIE to be used as a top-level design that can be further developed if needed. Verilog output for simulation or synthesis is documented as part of the Verilog write process, this includes links to a [YoSys](http://bygone.clairexen.net/yosys/download.html) workflow for synthesis on FPGAs. Imperial College users can download a pre-installed VM for this workflow, the VHDL output is standalone and should work with other synthesis methods."

    title="Memory Editor"
    description="ISSIE allows users to directly edit the contents of Memory components, for more versitility and ease of use. Memory contents can also be exported and imported via .ram files.
